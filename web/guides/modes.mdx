## Overview

The Joyfill Components SDK supports three distinct modes that control how users can interact with your forms: **Edit Mode**, **Fill Mode**, and **Read-Only Mode**.

## Edit Mode (Default)

**Edit Mode** (`edit`) is the default mode that allows full form design, styling, and configuration capabilities.

```jsx

 <JoyDoc 
	 doc={document} 
	 onChange={handleChange} 
	 mode="edit" 
 />

```

**Features:**

- Full form design and layout capabilities
- Field creation, editing, and deletion
- Field positioning and resizing
- Form styling and theme customization
- Page management (create, duplicate, delete)
- Table and collection field management
- Formula configuration
- Field settings and validation rules
- All interactive design elements are functional

## Fill Mode

**Fill Mode** (`fill`) allows users to input data into pre-configured forms without design capabilities.

```jsx
const documentEditor = (
  <JoyDoc
    doc={document}
    onChange={handleChange}
    mode="fill"  // Must be explicitly set
  />
)

```

**Features:**

- Users can input data into all field types
- File uploads and camera capture are enabled
- Form validation is active
- Page navigation is available for multi-page forms
- Field interactions (focus, blur, change) are tracked
- All data entry functionality is operational
- Design elements are hidden or disabled

## Read-Only Mode

**Read-Only Mode** (`readonly`) displays forms for viewing only, preventing any user modifications.

```jsx
const documentEditor = (
  <JoyDoc
    doc={document}
    onChange={handleChange}
    mode="readonly"  // Must be explicitly set
  />
)

```

**Features:**

- All fields are disabled for input
- File uploads and camera capture are disabled
- Form data is displayed but cannot be modified
- Page navigation remains functional for multi-page forms
- Field interactions are limited to viewing
- All design and editing capabilities are disabled
- Form validation is not enforced
