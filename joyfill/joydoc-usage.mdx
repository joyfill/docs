description: "Getting started with the JoyDoc JSON standard."

The JoyDoc is what we call the standardized JSON structure that gets used by all Joyfill Platform UI Components, APIs, and Exports.

## The Why

The JoyDoc is the culmination of the best practices from web layout, design and interaction into the simplistic JSON data structure.

We have designed the JoyDoc from our first hand experience in what it actually takes to build any kind of form or pdf solution for today's applications.

This standardized JSON structure is capable of handling any data visualization, layout and collection requirement needed for digital forms or PDFs on web, desktop and mobile devices in your application or service.
