Here's how easy it is to get started with Joyfill:

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
import Joyfill
import JoyfillModel

struct SimpleFormExampleView: View {
    let documentEditor: DocumentEditor
    let document = loadDoc(named: "first-form")
    
    init() {
        self.documentEditor = DocumentEditor(document: document)
    }

    var body: some View {
        Form(documentEditor: documentEditor)
    }
}

private extension SimpleFormExampleView {
    static func loadDoc(named name: String) -> JoyDoc {
        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: name, withExtension: "json")!
        let data = try! Data(contentsOf: url)
        let dict = try! JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data) as! [String: Any]
        return JoyDoc(dictionary: dict)
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import joyfill.Form
import joyfill.rememberDocumentEditor

@Composable
fun SimpleFormExample() {
    val editor = rememberDocumentEditor(json = "") // paste ur json here

    Form(editor = editor)
}
```

```javascript React Native
import { JoyfillForm } from '@joyfill/react-native';

// Initialize
Joyfill.configure('your_token');

// Load form
<JoyfillForm
  mode="fill"
  templateId="your_template_id"
  onSubmit={(data) => console.log(data)}
/>
```

```javascript Web
import { Joyfill } from '@joyfill/web';

// Initialize

// Load form
const form = new Joyfill.Form({
  mode: 'fill',
  templateId: 'your_template_id',
  container: '#form-container'
});
form.load();
