## Metadata

The JoyDoc Document, File, Page, and Fields have a metadata parameter. You can use this parameter to attach arbitrary key-value data. This metadata can be used to add context, support your internal functionality, and much more.

You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 200 characters long.

Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your scoring, failing values, etc. from your system on a Joyfill Field object. Your users won't see metadata unless you show it to them.

Don't store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, personally identifiable info(PII) about a user and so on) in metadata.
