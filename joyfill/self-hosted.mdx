# Overview

There are two primary integration paths when working with the Joyfill Platform: Joyfill Managed Data and Self Hosted Data.

If you are wondering which type of integration path is right for your use case please feel free to reach out on the [site](https://joyfill.io/developers/) via our chat and a customer success team member can setup a call with our engineering and platform specialists.

# Self Hosting Data

Joyfill enables you to utilize your own data with most of the Joyfill Platform solutions without us retaining any of that information in our own system.

| Solution                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web and Mobile Components** | Joyfill Web and Mobile Components can be used within your own applications without the need to interact with any Joyfill APIs or Systems. You can utilize all the power of the Joyfill Builder, Filler, and Previewer with your own internal data.                                 |
| **Exports**                   | Joyfill's Export solution can generate exports, populated PDFs, and much more using only a properly formatted JSON payload. Joyfill doesn't need to store or retain this information to generate these reports. Simply send us a JSON payload and we can send back the PDF export. |

## Reasons to self-host

* **Compliance Requirements** - This integration path can help accomplish compliance requirements you may have within your organization and application.
* **Pre-existing/Legacy System** - This integration path can be utilized to enhance a pre-existing solution or product. With a pre-existing solution it's likely that you already have users, stored data, and much more within your system and have no interested in moving that to a third party integration partner. The self-hosted route allows you to retain all your pre-existing data internally but still utilize core Joyfill Components.
