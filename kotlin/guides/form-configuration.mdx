This document describes the configuration options available when initializing a `DocumentEditor` for customizing form behavior, including page management and field interactions.

## Page Management

### Page Navigation

Control the visibility of the page navigation UI.

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    // Use the default page navigation (recommended)
    // navigation parameter can be omitted to use the default
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation` | `@Composable ((PageCollection, PageCollectionState) -> Unit)?` | Default page selector | Composable slot for the page navigation UI. Set to `null` to hide navigation entirely. |

**Behavior:**

- The default navigation displays a page selector dropdown that allows users to switch between pages
- The page selector respects conditional logic - hidden pages are not shown in the list
- Pass `null` to completely hide the page navigation UI:

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    navigation = null  // Hide page navigation UI
)
```

### Page Deletion

Control whether users can delete pages from multi-page forms.

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    isPageDeleteEnabled = true,
    mode = Mode.fill,
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDeleteEnabled` | `Boolean` | `false` | When `true`, users can delete pages via the page navigation UI. A confirmation dialog appears before deletion to prevent accidental data loss. |

**Behavior:**

- When enabled, a delete icon appears next to each page in the page selector
- Delete is only available when there is more than one page (you cannot delete the last remaining page)
- A confirmation dialog prompts the user before deletion
- Page deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Page deletion only works in `Mode.fill`

### Page Duplication

Control whether users can duplicate existing pages.

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    isPageDuplicateEnabled = true,
    mode = Mode.fill,
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDuplicateEnabled` | `Boolean` | `false` | When `true`, users can duplicate pages via the page navigation UI. The duplicated page includes all field values from the original. |

**Behavior:**

- When enabled, a duplicate icon appears next to each page in the page selector
- Duplicated pages retain all field values from the source page, including conditional logic and formulas
- The new page is inserted immediately after the source page
- Page duplication only works in `Mode.fill`

## Field Interactions

### Single Click Row Edit

Simplify the process for opening table and collection rows for editing.

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    singleClickRowEdit = true,
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `singleClickRowEdit` | `Boolean` | `false` | When `true`, users can open a row for editing with a single tap. When `false`, users must go through multiple steps to edit a row. |

**Behavior:**

- **Default (`false`)**: Users must follow multiple steps to open a row form
- **Enabled (`true`)**: Users can open the row form for editing with a single tap
- This setting applies to both Table fields and Collection fields
- The edit behavior respects the form's mode - in `Mode.readonly`, rows cannot be edited regardless of this setting

## Schema Validation

Control whether the document schema is validated during initialization.

```kotlin
val editor = rememberDocumentEditor(
    document = myDocument,
    validateSchema = true,
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validateSchema` | `Boolean` | `true` | When `true`, validates the document schema version and structure during initialization. Validation errors are exposed via `editor.error`. |

**Behavior:**

- If validation fails, `editor.error` will contain a non-null error value
- The form will display an error screen instead of the document content
- Set to `false` to skip validation (useful for testing or when you're certain the document is valid)

## Programmatic Page Operations

You can perform page operations programmatically using the `PageCollection` API available via `editor.pages`.

### Navigate to a Page

```kotlin
editor.pages.navigate("page_456")
```

### Duplicate a Page

```kotlin
editor.pages.duplicate("page_123", "Copy of Page")
```

### Delete a Page

```kotlin
editor.pages.delete("page_123")
```
