This document describes how to programmatically navigate to pages, and fields within a form using the `goto` API on `DocumentEditor`.

## Overview

The `goto` method enables programmatic navigation to specific locations within a form. This is useful for:
- Guiding users to required fields after validation
- Implementing custom navigation flows
- Deep linking to specific form sections

## Path-Based Navigation

Navigate using a slash-separated path string.

```kotlin
// Navigate to a page
editor.goto("page_123")

// Navigate to a field on a page
editor.goto("page_123/fieldPos_456")
```

| Path Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"pageId"` | Navigate to the top of the specified page |
| `"pageId/fieldPositionId"` | Navigate to the page and scroll to the field |

<Warning>
**Important:** Use `fieldPositionId` from `page.fieldPositions[]._id`, not `fieldId` from `document.fields[]._id`. Using the wrong ID will cause navigation to fail.
</Warning>

## NavResponse

The `goto` method returns a `NavResponse` indicating success or failure.

```kotlin
val response = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPos_456")

when (response) {
    is NavResponse.Success -> {
        // Navigation succeeded - target exists and is visible
    }
    is NavResponse.Failure -> {
        // Navigation failed - target doesn't exist, is hidden, or unsupported
    }
}
```

| Response | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Success` | The target exists, is supported, and is visible |
| `Failure` | The target does not exist, is hidden, or has an unsupported field type |

**Failure reasons include:**
- Page does not exist
- Page is hidden (due to conditional logic)
- Field position does not exist
- Field is hidden (due to conditional logic)
- Field type is unsupported (`file`, `unknown`)

## Page Change Events

Page changes triggered by `goto()` are emitted through the `onBlur` and `onFocus` callbacks. When the user navigates from one page to another (either via `goto()` or manual navigation), the callbacks receive a `ComponentEvent.PageEvent`:

```kotlin
Form(
    editor = editor,
    onBlur = { event ->
        if (event is ComponentEvent.PageEvent) {
            // User left this page
            println("Left page: ${event.pageId}")
        }
    },
    onFocus = { event ->
        if (event is ComponentEvent.PageEvent) {
            // User arrived at this page
            println("Arrived at page: ${event.pageId}")
        }
    }
)
```

| Event | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `onBlur` with `PageEvent` | Emitted when navigating away from a page |
| `onFocus` with `PageEvent` | Emitted when navigating to a page |

**`PageEvent` Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | `Page` | The page object that gained or lost focus |
| `pageId` | `String` | The page ID |
