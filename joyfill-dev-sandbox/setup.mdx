# Setup Steps

The steps below are the prerequisites you will need to accomplish before moving on to the rest of our getting started guides. A couple of the steps below will be done in our [Joyfill Manager.](/joyfill-dev-sandbox/platform-joyfill-manager)

## Step 1: Create Joyfill Account

To begin working with Joyfill, go to [Joyfill's Platform](http://app-joy.joyfill.io/) and create an account (*jump to step 2 if you already have an account*). By creating an account you will add yourself as the first user to your newly created Joyfill Organization and be placed inside the Joyfill Manager.

## Step 2: Generate Your `userAccessToken`

Once you're inside the Joyfill Manager you will want to select from the top navigation bar Settings & Users -> Manager Users -> and click "Access Tokens" button next to your user. Once the modal appears select "Add Access Token". Copy and securely store your access token for later use.

## Step 3: Create Your First Template

Create your first template within the Joyfill Manager by going to the [Template Library](https://app-joy.joyfill.io/library) tab in the top navigation and click the "Add Template".

We recommended following this guide [Create Your First Template](/docs/how-to-create-templates) when creating your first template. This makes it easy to experiment with the different parts of the Joyfill Platform easily.

## Step 4: Get your template `identifier`

Inside the Joyfill Manager you will want to select from the top navigation bar [Template Library](https://app-joy.joyfill.io/library) and under your Templates table list within the column `ID` copy that for pasting into our example React/JS guides.
