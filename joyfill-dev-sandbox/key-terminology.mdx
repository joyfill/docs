  * **Template Instance** - A document that was generated from a Template.
  * **Single Instance** - A document that is generated and meant to be used only once.

## Template vs Document

The Joyfill platform supports documents and templates. Documents and templates both share a similar data structure (the [JoyDoc](/joyfill/joydoc-usage)). Documents and templates provide a way to organize and utilize the data based on its intended use case within your product or service. By sharing a similar data structure it makes it really easy to work with documents and templates together/interchangeably.

### Template

The template type is used to power template based workflows within Joyfill.

A template is a saved set of fields, layouts, styles, etc. that will be populated via api request or filled out by a user repeatedly.

When you fill out a template it generates a document from the original template structure and schema.

### Document

The document type is the default and general purpose type for managing the Joyfill document data.

The document type can represent a single instance document, an instance of a filled out template and much more.
