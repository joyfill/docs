# What is the Joyfill Manager?

The [Joyfill Manager](https://app-joy.joyfill.io/login) empowers anyone on your team (customer success, technical support, developers, etc.) to manage, create, and remove Templates, Documents, PDFs, Customers, Access Tokens, etc. all through an easy to use admin portal.

No need to wait on the developers anymore. Everything can be managed, prepared, and published directly from the Joyfill Manager.

## Template Libraries

All templates in your organization library or in a group library have a `DRAFT` and a `PUBLISH` state that can be used to toggle which form templates are available to your users. This allows your team to work on forms and digital PDF templates without your users having access to them until they are ready.

## Groups

Groups are a way to manage templates, documents, and users for one of your customers. You can think of Groups as a way to group things under an individual customer.

# Retrieve Template and Document Identifiers

In the Joyfill Manager you can retrieve template and document identifiers under the ID column.
