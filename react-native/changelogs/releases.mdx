## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.1.x to 1.2.x

The 1.2.0 release includes some breaking changes. Here's what you need to update:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Dependencies">
    Update your Package.swift or Podfile to version 1.2.0
    ```swift
    .package(url: "https://github.com/joyfill/joyfill-ios", from: "1.2.0")
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Theme Configuration">
    Replace `JoyfillAppearance` with new `JoyfillTheme`:
    ```swift
    // Old way
    let appearance = JoyfillAppearance()
    appearance.primaryColor = .blue
    formView.appearance = appearance
    
    // New way
    let theme = JoyfillTheme()
    theme.colors.primary = .blue
    formView.theme = theme
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Delegate Methods">
    Some delegate methods have new signatures:
    ```swift
    // Old
    func formDidSubmit(_ form: JoyfillForm, data: [String: Any])
    
    // New
    func formDidSubmit(_ form: JoyfillForm, result: JoyfillSubmitResult)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
