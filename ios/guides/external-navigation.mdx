This document describes how to programmatically navigate to pages and fields within a form using the `goto` API on `DocumentEditor`.

## Overview

The `goto` method enables programmatic navigation to specific locations within a form. This is useful for:
- Guiding users to required fields after validation
- Implementing custom navigation flows
- Deep linking to specific form sections
- Auto-scrolling to specific fields

## Path-Based Navigation

Navigate using a slash-separated path string.

```swift
// Navigate to a page
let status = editor.goto("page_123")

// Navigate to a field on a page (with auto-scroll)
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456")
```

| Path Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"pageId"` | Navigate to the top of the specified page |
| `"pageId/fieldPositionId"` | Navigate to the page and automatically scroll to the field |

<Warning>
**Important:** Use `fieldPositionId` from `page.fieldPositions[]._id`, not `fieldId` from `document.fields[]._id`. Using the wrong ID will cause navigation to fail.
</Warning>

## NavigationStatus

The `goto` method returns a `NavigationStatus` indicating success or failure.

```swift
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456")

switch status {
case .success:
    // Navigation succeeded - target exists and is visible
    print("Successfully navigated to the field")
case .failure:
    // Navigation failed - target doesn't exist, is hidden, or unsupported
    print("Navigation failed")
}
```

| Response | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.success` | The target exists, is supported, and is visible |
| `.failure` | The target does not exist, is hidden, or has an unsupported field type |

**Failure reasons include:**
- Page does not exist
- Page is hidden (due to conditional logic)
- Field position does not exist
- Field is hidden (due to conditional logic)
