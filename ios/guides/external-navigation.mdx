This document describes how to programmatically navigate to pages, fields, and table/collection rows within a form using the `goto` API on `DocumentEditor`.

## Overview

The `goto` method enables programmatic navigation to specific locations within a form. This is useful for:
- Guiding users to required fields after validation
- Implementing custom navigation flows
- Deep linking to specific form sections
- Auto-scrolling to specific fields
- Opening a specific table or collection row in its row form (modal)

## Path-Based Navigation

Navigate using a slash-separated path string. Up to three segments are supported.

```swift
// Navigate to a page
let status = editor.goto("page_123")

// Navigate to a field on a page (with auto-scroll)
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456")

// Navigate to a table or collection row (optionally open row form)
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456/row_789", gotoConfig: GotoConfig(open: true))
```

| Path Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"pageId"` | Navigate to the top of the specified page |
| `"pageId/fieldPositionId"` | Navigate to the page and automatically scroll to the field |
| `"pageId/fieldPositionId/rowId"` | Navigate to the page, scroll to the table/collection field, and select the row. Use `GotoConfig(open: true)` to also open the row form modal. |

<Warning>
**Important:** Use `fieldPositionId` from `page.fieldPositions[]._id`, not `fieldId` from `document.fields[]._id`. Using the wrong ID will cause navigation to fail.
</Warning>

For row-level paths, the field must be a **table** or **collection** type. The `rowId` must match an existing row’s ID in that field’s value; otherwise `goto` returns `.failure`.

## GotoConfig

Navigation behavior is configured via `GotoConfig`. Pass it as the second argument to `goto`.

```swift
public struct GotoConfig {
    /// When true, automatically opens the row form modal for table/collection rows.
    public let open: Bool

    public init(open: Bool = false)
}
```

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | `false` | If the path targets a table/collection row (`pageId/fieldPositionId/rowId`), set to `true` to open that row’s form in a modal after navigation. |

Example: navigate to a row and open its form for editing.

```swift
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456/row_789", gotoConfig: GotoConfig(open: true))
```

If you omit `gotoConfig`, the default `GotoConfig()` is used (same as `open: false`).

## NavigationStatus

The `goto` method returns a `NavigationStatus` indicating success or failure.

```swift
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456", gotoConfig: GotoConfig())

switch status {
case .success:
    // Navigation succeeded - target exists and is visible
    print("Successfully navigated to the field")
case .failure:
    // Navigation failed - target doesn't exist, is hidden, or unsupported
    print("Navigation failed")
}
```

| Response | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.success` | The target exists, is supported, and is visible (and for row paths, the row exists in the field). |
| `.failure` | The target does not exist, is hidden, or has an unsupported field type. |

**Failure reasons include:**
- Page does not exist
- Page is hidden (due to conditional logic)
- Field position does not exist
- Field is hidden (due to conditional logic)
- For row-level paths: field is not a table/collection, or the row ID is not found in the field’s value
