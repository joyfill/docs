This document describes the configuration options available when initializing a `DocumentEditor` for customizing form behavior, including page management, field interactions.

## Page Management

### Page Navigation

Control the visibility of the page navigation UI.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    navigation: true  // Show page navigation UI
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation` | `Bool` | `true` | When `true`, displays the page navigation dropdown button that allows users to switch between pages. |

**Behavior:**

- Clicking the button opens a modal sheet showing all available pages
- The page selector respects conditional logic - hidden pages are not shown in the list


### Page Duplication

Control whether users can duplicate existing pages.

```swift
import Joyfill
import JoyfillModel

let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    mode: .fill,  // Page duplication only works in .fill mode
    isPageDuplicateEnabled: true
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDuplicateEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, users can duplicate pages via the page navigation UI. The duplicated page includes all field values from the original. |

**Behavior:**

- Duplicated pages retain all field values from the source page, including conditional logic
- The new page is inserted immediately after the source page in the page order
- Field IDs are regenerated for all fields on the duplicated page to ensure uniqueness

### Page Deletion

Control whether users can delete pages from multi-page forms.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    mode: .fill,  // Page deletion only works in .fill mode
    isPageDeleteEnabled: true
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDeleteEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, users can delete pages via the page navigation UI. A confirmation dialog appears before deletion to prevent accidental data loss. |

**Behavior:**

- Delete is only available when there is more than one page (you cannot delete the last remaining page)
- A confirmation dialog appears to user before deletion
- Page deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- If the current page is deleted, the form automatically navigates to the next available page

## Field Interactions

### Single Click Row Edit

Simplify the process for opening table and collection rows for editing.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    singleClickRowEdit: true
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `singleClickRowEdit` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, users can open a row for editing with a single tap. When `false`, users must go through multiple steps to edit a row. |

**Behavior:**

- **Default (`false`)**: Users must follow multiple steps to open a row form
  
- **Enabled (`true`)**: Users can open the row form for editing with a single tap, providing a faster and easier editing experience

- This setting applies to both Table fields and Collection fields
- The edit behavior respects the form's mode - in `.readonly` mode, rows cannot be edited regardless of this setting

## Schema Validation

Control whether the document schema is validated during initialization.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    validateSchema: true  // Validate schema on init
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validateSchema` | `Bool` | `true` | When `true`, validates the document schema version and structure during initialization. Validation errors are reported via the `onError` event handler. |

**Behavior:**

- If validation fails, `editor.schemaError` will contain error details
- The form will display an error screen instead of the document
- Validation errors are also sent to the `events.onError()` handler if configured
- Set to `false` to skip validation (useful for testing or when you're certain the document is valid)

## Programmatic Navigation

Navigate to specific pages, fields, or rows programmatically using the `goto` function.

### Navigate to Page, Field, or Row

```swift
// Navigate to a page
let status = editor.goto("page_123")

// Navigate to a specific field on a page
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456")

// Navigate to a specific row in a table/collection field
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456/row_789")

// Navigate to a row and open the edit form
let status = editor.goto("page_123/fieldPosition_456/row_789", open: true)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `String` | required | Navigation path in format `"pageId"`, `"pageId/fieldPositionId"`, or `"pageId/fieldPositionId/rowId"` |
| `open` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, opens the row edit form for table/collection fields. Only applicable when navigating to a specific row. |

**Returns:** `NavigationStatus` - `.success` if navigation was successful, `.failure` if the target doesn't exist or is hidden by conditional logic.

**Behavior:**

- **Page-only navigation**: Navigates to the top of the specified page
- **Page + Field navigation**: Navigates to the page and scrolls to the specified field
- **Page + Field + Row navigation**: Navigates to the page, scrolls to the field, and optionally opens the row edit form
- If the target page is hidden by conditional logic, navigation fails and returns `.failure`
- If the target field is hidden by conditional logic, the form navigates to the top of the page and returns `.failure`
- For row navigation, the field must be a table or collection field type, otherwise navigation falls back to the field level
- Row edit forms only open when `open: true` is specified for table/collection fields

## Programmatic Page Operations

You can also perform page operations programmatically using the `DocumentEditor` API.

### Duplicate a Page

```swift
// Duplicate a page programmatically
editor.duplicatePage(pageID: "page_123")
```

### Navigate to a Page

```swift
// Switch to a different page
editor.currentPageID = "page_456"
```
