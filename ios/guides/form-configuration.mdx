This document describes the configuration options available when initializing a `DocumentEditor` for customizing form behavior, including page management, field interactions, and UI settings.

## Page Management

### Page Navigation

Control the visibility of the page navigation UI.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    navigation: true  // Show page navigation UI
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation` | `Bool` | `true` | When `true`, displays the page navigation dropdown button that allows users to switch between pages. |

**Behavior:**

- When enabled, a dropdown button with the current page name appears at the top of the form
- Clicking the button opens a modal sheet showing all available pages
- The page selector respects conditional logic - hidden pages are not shown in the list


### Page Duplication

Control whether users can duplicate existing pages.

```swift
import Joyfill
import JoyfillModel

let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    mode: .fill,  // Page duplication only works in .fill mode
    isPageDuplicateEnabled: true
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDuplicateEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, users can duplicate pages via the page navigation UI. The duplicated page includes all field values from the original. |

**Behavior:**

- When enabled, a duplicate icon appears next to each page in the page selector
- Duplicated pages retain all field values from the source page, including conditional logic
- The new page is inserted immediately after the source page in the page order
- Field IDs are regenerated for all fields on the duplicated page to ensure uniqueness

### Page Deletion

Control whether users can delete pages from multi-page forms.

```swift
let editor = DocumentEditor(
    document: myDocument,
    mode: .fill,  // Page deletion only works in .fill mode
    isPageDeleteEnabled: true
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isPageDeleteEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | When `true`, users can delete pages via the page navigation UI. A confirmation dialog appears before deletion to prevent accidental data loss. |

**Behavior:**

- When enabled, a delete icon appears next to each page in the page selector
- Delete is only available when there is more than one page (you cannot delete the last remaining page)
- A confirmation dialog appears to user before deletion
- Page deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- If the current page is deleted, the form automatically navigates to the next available page


## Programmatic Page Operations

You can also perform page operations programmatically using the `DocumentEditor` API.

### Duplicate a Page

```swift
// Duplicate a page programmatically
editor.duplicatePage(pageID: "page_123")
```

### Navigate to a Page

```swift
// Switch to a different page
editor.currentPageID = "page_456"
```
