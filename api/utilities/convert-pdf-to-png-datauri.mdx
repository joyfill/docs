Convert a PDF into page background images.

# Overview

Joyfill converts PDF files into individual images that can be used for the page backgrounds. This is a utility route that handles the PDF conversion for you. You simply need to get the Data URI of the uploaded PDF file and send it to the conversion endpoint. Joyfill will return an array of image urls generated from the PDF.
