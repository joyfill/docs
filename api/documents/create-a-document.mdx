# Document Creation Strategies

When creating documents within Joyfill there are two strategies you can use: Raw Document and Document from Template.

## Raw Document

With this method you pass the raw `files` and `fields` on the body param. These params will be used for creating the document.

**Can the`template` body param be used with this strategy?**

Yes. The `template` will only be used as the source reference to the template you specified. The custom `files` and `fields` will be used for the actual document creation.

**Why would anyone pass in raw`files` and `fields` with the `template` param?**

This is usually done when the document from template creation cycle is managed on the client side. This strategy allows the new document with all the modifications, updates, etc. and the reference to the original template to all be created with a single request.

**Example Body**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "name": "New Document",
    "group": "group_id",
    "files": [JoyDocFileObject, ...],
    "fields": [JoyDocFieldObject, ...],
    ...
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Document From Template

With this method you can leave the `files` and `fields` params empty and simply pass the `template` param on the body and the Joyfill API will use the template to generate a new document with `files` and `fields` from the template.

**Example Body**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "name": "New Document",
    "group": "group_id",
    "template": "temp_identifier",
    ...
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
