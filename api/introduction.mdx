description: "Getting started with the Joyfill API"
---

The Joyfill API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

# Hosts

The primary host is `api-joy.joyfill.io` for both read and write operations. All API access must use HTTPS and will require [Authentication](/docs/authentication).

# Format

The entire API uses JSON encoded as UTF-8.

The body of POST and PUT requests must be either a JSON object or a JSON array (depending on the particular endpoint) and their Content-Type header should be set to application/json; charset=UTF-8.

The body of responses is always a JSON object, and their content type is always application/json; charset=UTF-8.

# Authentication

Joyfill uses API keys and User Access Tokens to authenticate API requests.

# Identifiers

Identifiers represent readable IDs for resources inside of Joyfill. Identifiers are the primary way you will query, update, and remove resources via the Joyfill API.
