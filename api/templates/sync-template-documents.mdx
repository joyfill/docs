Sync the latest template styles and layout changes to pre-existing template documents

This API request uses a paginated approach for updating the template documents. You will need to make the request for each of the "pages" returned in the response object.

For instance, see the example response below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "page": 1,
    "pages": 4,
    "total": 1000
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In order to properly update all associated documents you will need to call this API route 4 times in order to page through all the documents associated with the template.
